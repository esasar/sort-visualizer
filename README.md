# Sort visualizer

Simple, interactive sorting visualizer built with [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) and [TailwindCSS](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss). The app allows for visualization of sorting algorithm(s) (currently only bubblesort).

  

Done as an exercise on doing to make a simple yet sleek looking, interactive and dynamic web-app with some practical use.

Deployed [here](https://esasar.github.io/sort-visualizer/)!
